Description of the project: Basic Blockchain Website Created By Using HTML/CSS

Functionlity: The website contains three pages "Home", "FAQ" and "Resources. The home page includes the intro to blockchain sections and a stylish subscribe form section. FAQ page includes frequently asked questions related to blockchain. On the Resources page, I added a few useful blockchain development resources as the demand for a blockchain developer is increasing day by day.

Technologies Used: HTML and CSS

Ideas For Future Improvement: 1- Add blog page that contain articles related to blockchain, 2- Integrate email service for newsletter submission, 3- Add video popup section whenever user click on any video link
