          <h2>Blockchain Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Blockchain is a decentralized public network that enables users and companies to securely store and transfer information and currency. A blockchain is the process of storing data in "blocks" of information and linking them together in a permanent "chain." As new blocks are added to the chain, the previous blocks become even harder to modify, which allows each block to become more and more secure over time.

          <h2>Blockchain is important!</h2>
          <p>
            Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. For delivering that information, blockchain is ideal because it delivers instant, shared, and transparent data stored on an immutable ledger that can only be accessed by members of the permissioned network. Blockchain networks can track orders, payments, accounts, production, and much more.

          <h2>How Is Blockchain Used?</h2>
          <p>
            Blockchains store information on monetary transactions using cryptocurrencies, but they also store other types of information, such as product tracking and other data. For example, food products can be tracked from the moment they are shipped out, all throughout their journey, and up until final delivery. This information can be helpful because if there is a contamination outbreak, the source of the outbreak can be easily traced. This is just one of the many ways that blockchains can store important data for organizations.

          <h3>Highly Secure</h3>
          <p>Blockchain technology can significantly improve your ability to view critical information. Blockchain creates a record that can't be altered and is encrypted end-to-end, preventing fraud and unauthorized activity.</p>

          <h3>Decentralized System</h3>
          <p>Traditionally, transactions require approval from regulatory bodies such as a bank or government; however, with Blockchain, transactions are conducted by consensus of users, making them faster, safer, and smoother.</p>

          <h3>Immutable records
          </h3>
          <p>No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.</p>
